# TODO
* Improve the UI.

* change the checkout page from EditText to Button Click and enter text in a dialog. Reason is because EditText inside a listview is very tricky, since edittext will lose focus as we are typing inside a listview.

* implement the API and remove the hardcode img links

* Holding an image insde the gallery should shown a popup where it show the detail information about the food selected.
